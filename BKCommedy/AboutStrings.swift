struct AboutStrings {

    let about = "The Brooklyn Comedy Festival was created to celebrate the scene and to give every level of performer a chance to shine on Brooklyn’s many stages.\n\nEach year, the festival showcases both established and up-and-coming performers from every realm of comedy, including sketch, standup, improv, and web series. In addition to shows, there are panel discussions and after parties throughout Brooklyn hosted by local and national sponsors.\n\nFrom Hannibal Buress dropping by to perform at opening night in 2013, to Mike O’Brien moving on to join the cast of Saturday Night Live, Nick Turner selling an original show to Comedy Central soon after his performance, Reggie Watts appearing at the first Winter Wonderlandia show as Brooklyn Comedy Festival’s “special guest”, and 2014 performers Michael Che and Hasan Minhaj cast on The Daily Show as correspondents along with Trevor Noah hired to replace Jon Stewart as the host, the Brooklyn Comedy Festival continues to have some great surprises and successes for attendees and performers alike.\n\nPast sponsors include Adult Swim, Jameson Irish Whiskey, Kill Rock Stars, Tito’s Handmade Vodka, Brooklyn Brewery, Sixpoint Brewery, Tullamore Dew Irish Whiskey, and Mailchimp.\n\nThe Brooklyn Comedy Festival was founded by producer Ashleigh Walker and performers Julian Kiani and Chris Nester."
